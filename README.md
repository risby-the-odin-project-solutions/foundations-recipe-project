# Recipe Page

- [Based on this Odin Project exercise]()

## About

- I wanted to practice my HTML, CSS, and JS fundamentals so I decided to attempt this [Odin Project challenge](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes) 
- Other things I wanted to practice with this project are:
  - CSS Grid
  - Webpack

## Roadmap

- [ ] Use CSS grid to create 3-column layout
- [ ] Use webpack to dynamically load data into recipe page
- [ ] Use webpack to minify code for deployment
